Newsfeed is a quick showcase of an inline styled, function based, New York Times API top stories React based viewer. This project was completed in 6-7 hours as a showcase of my skills in a short timeframe for a mock-take-home project at Turing.

Either use the green "download code" button ![downloadbutton](https://imgur.com/lYy4FVP.png) at the top of the page to copy a clone link or right-click [here](https://github.com/natesheridan/Stonki.git) and click "Copy link address"

From there open your terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to store the web app inside of

Once you are in the directory execute the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/natesheridan/Newsfeed.git
```
(this command assumes that the Github link you copied above matches.)

then navigate inside of the directory and run the following commands to run the developer server:

```bash
  cd Newsfeed
  npm install
  npm start
```
After you have started the server you should be able to find the website visible at [this URL](http://localhost:3000)
